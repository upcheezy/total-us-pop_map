# Total US Population circa 2017
In this project I'm utilizing a Pandas (Python) workflow to pull in a Natural Earth dataset and join it up with a CSV of population data. I'm taking the ouput of that process and creating a Leaflet webmap.

## How to Run this Notebook
- Clone this repository and open the *module07 Final Project* notebook
- If you're using Anaconda, I've added a yaml file you can import to get all of the necessary dependancies. You can do that using: 
    - `conda env update --file environment.yml`
- After all of the commands have run successfuly, you can launch the index.html file using your favorite text editor. I like VS Code. You can also view it here: https://maps.sc811.com/us_population/
